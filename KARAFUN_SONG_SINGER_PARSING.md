# Karafun Song & Singer Parsing Update

## ‚úÖ **Enhanced Parsing Implementation**

Based on the Karafun queue screenshot, I've updated the parsing logic to extract both **song names** and **singer names** from the queue.

### üéµ **What Gets Parsed:**

From entries like:

```
End of the Road
Sung by LAST SONG = 9PM

How Do You Like Me Now
Sung by Briar

Don't Blink
Sung by Cowboy Nick
```

### üîß **Updated Components:**

#### **Backend Changes:**

1. **Updated Interface** (`karafun.interface.ts`):
   - Added `currentSong?: string` to display the song being sung
   - Added `totalSongs?: number` to show how many songs a singer has queued

2. **Enhanced Parsing Logic** (`karafun.service.ts`):
   - **Primary Pattern**: Extracts song title + "Sung by [Singer]" pairs
   - **Fallback Pattern**: Falls back to singer-only extraction if song parsing fails
   - **Data Cleaning**: Removes HTML artifacts and normalizes text
   - **Duplicate Prevention**: Ensures unique singers in the list

#### **Frontend Changes:**

1. **Updated Service Interface** (`karafunService.ts`):
   - Matching interface updates for song information

2. **Enhanced UI Display** (`KarafunAccordion.tsx`):
   - Shows song name with music note emoji (üéµ)
   - Displays singer name prominently
   - Shows additional info: position, song count, join time
   - Color-coded song titles in teal (#4ecdc4)

### üéØ **Expected Results:**

With the hardcoded URL `https://www.karafun.com/080601/`, the parser will extract:

**Unique Singers:**

- **LAST SONG = 9PM** - Song: "End of the Road" (appears multiple times)
- **START ROTATION>>>** - Song: "End of the Road"
- **Briar** - Song: "How Do You Like Me Now" (+ 3 more songs)
- **Cowboy Nick** - Song: "Don't Blink" (+ 3 more songs)
- **NateDaawwwwwwguh** - Song: "Wicked Game"
- **ADAM** - Song: "Doin' This"

### üöÄ **How to Test:**

1. Go to any show ‚Üí "Sing" tab
2. Click "Parse Karafun Queue" button
3. The accordion will show:
   - Singer names with colored avatars
   - Current song with üéµ icon
   - Position numbers
   - Song counts (e.g., "4 songs" for Briar)

### üìù **Parsing Features:**

- **Smart Cleaning**: Removes HTML tags and normalizes spacing
- **Duplicate Detection**: Only shows unique singers once
- **Song Tracking**: Maps multiple songs to singers
- **Flexible Patterns**: Handles various HTML structures
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if parsing fails

The system now provides a comprehensive view of both who's singing and what songs they have queued!
